# localStorageTracker

This is a javascript-based tracking system using local storage - it's fast, secure, and pretty simple to add to.

I've also added some sample code that helps when submitting the tracking results using any sort of send.php function. This will help capturing lead data after they fill out a form. An alternative choice would be to store this information in a separate tracking application, but that's out of the scope of this simple project.
